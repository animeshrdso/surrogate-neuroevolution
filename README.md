Distributed Bayesian Optimization - NeuroEvolution

## Code
We have three different sets of problems:
* First set includes Iris, Cancer and Chess problems : [pso_distributed](https://github.com/sydney-machine-learning/surrogate-neuroevolution/tree/master/pso_distributed).           * Run the file [pso_dist.py] using [run_pso.sh] for DSNE versions.                                                                                                               * Run the file [surr_revamp_syncswap.py] using [run_surr_revamp_syncswap.sh] for surrogate version- BONE.                                                                       * Run the file [surr_sch.py] using [run_surr_sch.sh] for surrogate version- BONE*.
